# datastructure
# linked list
* A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links. Linked List is a sequence of links * * which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array.
# queue 
* A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
# stack
* A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages. It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example â€“ a deck of cards or a pile of plates.This feature makes it LIFO data structure. LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out.
# time-compexity
* We go over the concepts of time & space complexity, along with how these concepts are quantified with Big O notation.

* We provide in depth examples showing how different program structures effect the runtime of a some basic JavaScript programs.
